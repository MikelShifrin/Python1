#File Encryption

#Write a program that uses a dictionary to assign
#"codes" to each letter of the alphabet. For example
'''
codes = {'A': '%', 'a': '^', 'B':'!', etc...}
'''
#In this example the letter A would become %
#
#The program should open a text file, read it,
#Then use the dictionary to write an encrypted
#version of the file's content to a second file.
#Each character in the second file should contain
#the code for the corresponding character in the
#first file
