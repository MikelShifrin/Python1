exercice 1

recursive printing
design a recursive function that accepts an integer argument, n, and prints 
the numbers 1 up through n.

exercice 2

recursive multiplication problem
design a recursive function that accepts 2 arguments into the parameters x and y. 
The function should return the value of x times y. Remember, multiplication can 
be performed as repeated addition as follows:
7 x 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4

exercice 3

recursive power method
design a function that uses recursion to raise a number to a power.
The function should accept 2 arguments: the number to be raised, and the exponent.
Assume the exponent is a nonnegative integer.
